## Usage

To use the Social Network API, you need to make HTTP requests to the provided endpoints using your preferred tool (e.g., Postman, cURL).

Detailed documentation for each endpoint and its parameters can be found in the [API Documentation](./API_DOCUMENTATION.md) file.

## Authentication

The Social Network API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. To access protected endpoints, you need to include a valid JWT token in the `Authorization` header of your requests.

To obtain a JWT token, you can make a POST request to the `/api/auth/login` endpoint with valid credentials (username and password). The API will respond with a token that you can use for subsequent requests.

## Error Handling

The API follows RESTful principles and returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages in case of failures. Please refer to the [API Documentation](./API_DOCUMENTATION.md) for a detailed list of error codes and their meanings.
